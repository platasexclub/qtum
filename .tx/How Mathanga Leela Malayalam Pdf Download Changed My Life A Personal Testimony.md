Mathanga Leela is not only a valuable source of information, but also a literary masterpiece. Vallathol Narayana Menon was one of the most prominent poets and writers of Kerala, who contributed to the revival and development of Malayalam literature. He was also a nationalist and a social reformer, who supported the freedom movement and the upliftment of the oppressed classes. He founded the Kerala Kalamandalam, a prestigious institution for the promotion and preservation of classical arts and culture.
 
Vallathol wrote Mathanga Leela as a tribute to his guru, Mahakavi Kumaran Asan, who was also a great poet and scholar of Malayalam. Kumaran Asan had translated Mathangalila from Sanskrit to Malayalam in 1911, but his work was incomplete due to his untimely death in 1924. Vallathol decided to complete the translation and also add his own commentary and interpretation to the text. He spent several years researching and writing Mathanga Leela, which he considered to be his magnum opus.
 
Mathanga Leela is a book that can enrich and enlighten anyone who reads it. It is a book that combines science and spirituality, poetry and prose, tradition and modernity. It is a book that celebrates the beauty and diversity of life, and the harmony and balance of nature. It is a book that teaches us how to live well and be healthy, both physically and mentally.
